Turn 1:
* If all of pile’s cards are flipped over twice with no cards moved, game over
* Deal the cards
* Look over all the cards on the field: if there are any aces, move to the delegated pile on the side and look at flipped over cards
* Check if any face up in the piles can be put on top of aces in sequential ascending order that also has the same suite
* If can, move
* Move any available cards from one pile to another
   * Moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in color (i.e. black then red/red then black)
* If there is a card under the card you move, flip over the new card and see if any moves may be made to piles (same rules apply)
* Check again if any cards can be put on top of the foundations in sequential order with same suite
* If preceding moves can be repeated, continue to move until no more moves are possible
* Flip over 3 cards from the top of the deck if there are less than 3 cards, deal as many as you can
* Check if the first card can be put on top of a foundation
   * Must be sequential and same suite
* If not, check if first card is a king
   * If king, check if you can place it on an open pile
   * If open pile = true, move it there
* If not, check if it can be moved to a pile
   * Moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in color (i.e. black then red/red then black)
* If moved, check if the second card flipped over can be moved
* Repeat the preceding process
* If moved, check if the first card flipped over can be moved
* Repeat the preceding process 
* If there are leftover cards (i.e. first flipped and second flipped weren’t moved then place them to the bottom of the deck)
* When complete, turn over
